# Cluster Director MCP Extension for Gemini CLI

This document provides instructions for an AI agent on how to use the available tools to manage Google Cluster Director resources.

## Guiding Principles

*   **Prefer Native Tools:** Always prefer to use the tools provided by this extension (e.g., `list_clusters`, `get_cluster`) instead of shelling out to `gcloud` for the same functionality. This ensures better-structured data and more reliable execution.
*   **Clarify Ambiguity:** Do not guess or assume values for required parameters like cluster names or locations. If the user's request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions to confirm the exact resource they intend to interact with.
*   **Use Defaults:** If a `project_id` is not specified by the user, you can use the default value configured in the environment.
